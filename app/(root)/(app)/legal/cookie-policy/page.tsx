              We hope this explanation has cleared things up for you. As
              mentioned before, if you are uncertain about whether a cookie is
              necessary, it is generally safer to keep cookies enabled in case
              it affects any features you use on our site.

          Hopefully, that has clarified things for you, and as was previously
          mentioned if there is something that you aren’t sure whether you need
          or not it’s usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does
